Parts of [[Nyrissia]]
Fey can give up part of their soul and put it into an item. 

We think that the green string items we've found have part of Nyrissia in them. 

## Frederick (/Alexis)'s scry/vision on Nyrissia's items
There is one in [[Pitax]] that had been recently moved there. 
Hilt of a sword, with green hair *it feels more pure* than the other items we've found. It's *recently* moved to Pitax. 
There is one between [[Pitax]] and [[Numeria]] in a water clock drenched in green fluid. 
We also saw Nyrissia in a room with green vines and brambles. With a throne and lots of junk around it. 
We didn't sense any in Drevlev nor Forestdale. 

## Items we've found:

### Collar

Ruler of [[Pitax]].

We don't know how he go to power, but we know it was fast and under strange circumstances. 

Why did he invite us and Drevlev to the [[Rushlight Tournament]]? why was he making Hannis do all the challenges/competitions?

At the tournament he acted relaxed but was definitely dressed like an adventurer. 

We sent him a letter with "help" when dealing with the mist
He said he received letters from us that we never sent saying that everything was fine and we had no problems dealing with the mist. Which was an outright lie, which we know thanks to Eulalia's Commune with Abadar.

Suzi the gossiper at the Rushlight tournament: She saw a women sneak outside of his tent and head to Drevlev's camp which is strange because he usually shows off his women. We never found out who it was. Was it Tiifanny

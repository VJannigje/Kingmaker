We found them in the old temple where we found the evil naga first. They had been tormented by the evil naga for centuries by eating them every time they regenerated. 

They were protecting the [[holy avenger]] that Theo took on as his sword. 

They were protecting an old [[Kyonen]] outpost watchtower / signal tower (that needs the diamond that Eulalia took)  With the diamond the watchtower can see as far the other side of lake hooktongue (lake silverstep)

The evil naga took them by surprise and had tricks that they shouldn't have had. 

He suggests casting zone of truth, eulalia protests.
Instead he suggests to do an information exchange. 
Instead instead. He still casts zone of truth and eulalia casts discern lies. 

Fred asks about "The twin of that which was lost" that the evil naga was guarding. He doesn't know. 

He asks if we've spoken to [[Count Ranalc]] since we let him free. We say no.

Fred: what lies beneeth the boggard camp on the northern side of lake hooktongue's shore:
Jihiri: The dragon's home!

Alexis: Is your friend enemies with the people that live to the west?
Jihiri: 

Jihiri: Do you understand what you did when you released the guy? did you know what that would do? 
Us: No. (and we also ask how he knows, to which he replies that he is a very knowledgeable being, and his friend is as well.)

Us: what *is* happening?
Jihiri: We released someone who only wants power, who wants had it and will stop at nothing to regain their throne. Very dangerous and very good at convincing people to work for him and do his bidding. 

Jihiri: "I need to know where your allegiances lie"
Fred: His allegiance lies with forestdale and protecting that

His friend's name is [[Eranex]]

The boggards are fighting a war on three fronts:
1. Us
2. the north bank --> Eranex
3. The south --> the ants --> Bogstriders in the settlement of toc-nikrat

me: Why *are* you stil here if this place is no longer functioning as a watchtower for Kyonen? they currently don't really have anywhere to go. they are still fighting for a cause

He doesn't know if pitax is fighting for Count Ranalc / working for him.

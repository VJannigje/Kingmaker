![[Eranex.png]]
Song dragon(?) who is against Count Ranalc
friends with [[Jihiri]]
lives in the north of lake hooktongue

Eulalia lore:
Ze heeft het woord Eranex eerder gelezen in context met [[Shika the many]] who is one of the eldest who locked up Ranalc. Maybe even one of *the* eldest. "often" as a herald of Shika. (like cobblehoof for abadar) 
"Eranex" also comes from the word "era".

When we get to Eranex we see a feminine humanoid figure with long silver hair with blue/silver shiny fabric. the clothing is kind of like a toga(?)
Dark skin with very sharp features

She's sitting on a rock surrounded by a bunch of other rocks and invites us to come sit. (by patting the rock next to her after scooting over a bit)
Frederick sits next to her and the rest sits somewhere else.

The rumour goes that the lake silverstep used to be one giant footprint of a silver dragon. 

She's been following the area we live in for quite some time. there's lots of plots happening that started even before we came here. 
She's a young adult.

Her being there is a boon in itself. she's warning us of something that could cause us more harm in the future. 

Legend of Vesper:
Vesper is a noble name. It comes from the continent ferissia. The duke that still uses that name is somewhere near Corvosa. The head of the house presumably got a magical artifact (that belonged to shika), called Vespa's, rapier that was strong enough bend time. That he used to gain power. The original lord vespa and the artifact got lost somewhere in the corners of the world. 
The sword is already here... sort of... It's been seen that it will be here. 
Ranalc has his eyes set on the sword and would become more powerful than Shika if he would get his hands on it. 

There's a portal to the feywild underneath lake silverstep. It used to be the lair of a giant ass silver dragon. (whom happened to be Eranex's father, the great icewrym Silverstep)
the entrance to the lair is a series of water caves. 
Her mom used to be a courtier in the fey courts.
She can distract the population for long enough for us to not get noticed. 


The sword is set to appear for about 1-2 minutes in a day. preferred option is to just let the sword disappear again

Orsig has been in the lair for about a week now. and has some allies with him (from what eranex has been able to scout). He has a cleric of count Ranalc (a fletchling), rusalka (aquatic spellcasting fey), glimmersisters (tripplets of shey (humenoid shadows)).

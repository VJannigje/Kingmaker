[[Lady Aurelia ogden of Uringen]]
[[Rushlight Tournament]]
There is burning hole in the map of the world where  the green belt should be. You smell burning paper and blood. There is a battle field full of slain forestdale uniforms. You see the silhouette of a humanoid that killes us. His hands are bound together with manacles. When you zoom out you see the ropes of a puppet behind both yourself and the one who killed us. When we zoom out we are locked in a glass bottle. Locked away.  Het laatste wat je ziet, is een paar groene ogen.  

There is a lack of benevolance in that glare.

[[Green string items]]?? How did we only see two items and not our own or the one in Drevlev?

Is [[Marco Schreiber]] a pawn of [[Nyrissia]] or [[Count Ranalc]]? Is he his own? and who's side would he be on anyway? Is he [[Castruccio Irovetti]]'s pawn?
What was the plan with [[Hannis Drevlev]] and how the fuck was [[Bavetta Drevlev Stroon]] okay with keeping him in a dungeon?

Is the item that was taken from [[the Drevlev caves]] the sword that is now in Pitax?

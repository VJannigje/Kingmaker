Beneficial event at forestdale: noblesse oblige 
During the kingdom turn, a bald guy with a french mustache comes with a request(He’s the reprisentative): The van Houten family want to place a monument in our city to honour their family’s prestige. It’ll be a monument of their Matriark Belinda van Houten. We convince them to build it in Varnhold. A5

Eracen comes to Alexis. He wants to go back to Kionin. Alexis isn’t having it and wants to come with
Akiros comes with newest info from the west: They’re less nice neighbours. He’s placed some new people. 
Mudderton has changed. The mayor has gone, his house is being deconstructed and the stones are being used to build an eastern wall. This apparently happened after Marco Schreiber visited. 
Marco Schreiber went into the swamps alone and hasn’t been seen since. (2 days since he went in)

Er zijn momenteel geen duidelijke tekens op offensieven vanaf het westen. Er zijn minder patrouilles in het westen (en bij brinja) en worden opgebouwd in het oosten.
